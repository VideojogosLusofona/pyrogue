# Pyrogue

This is a simple roguelike game built in Python, as a students exercise of the [Licenciatura em Videojogos][lv] da
[Universidade Lus√≥fona de Humanidades e Tecnologias][ULHT] in Lisbon.

The particle system was built using:
* Python 3.11
* Pygame (https://www.pygame.org/news)

## History
---
[Map loading, movement and camera]

![Image](progress/screen01.png)

* Tiles can be created, and maps can be loaded from HD using a translation unit (that converts ASCII characters to tiles)
* Player can move around using the arrow keys. Camera will focus on the player at all times

---

[Added sprites]

[Stats, enemies and attacks]

![Image](progress/screen03.png)

* Character archetypes and stats
* UI elements
* Health, stamina and XP system
* Enemy spawning
* Player melee attack
* Combat text

---

[Simple AI introduced]

* Code adapted to be more similar to the code done in class
* AI chase code as done in class (simple controller model)

---

[Introduce Vector2 class]

* Added a Vector2 class to make the code a bit cleaner/easier to read


## Code Files

* pyrogue.py: Entrypoint for the code. Creates tiles, does the main application loop, retrieves input and calls the rendering code
* gamedata.py: Implements the GameData class, and creates the GAMEDATA singleton, through which most of the gamecode runs
* map.py: Implements the Map class, which takes care of the map, including rendering
* maptile.py: Implements the MapTile class, which acts like a prototype of an individual tile. There's only one instance of each map tile (for example, even if the map has 1000 grass tiles, they only point to a single MapTile object)
* character.py: Main character class, used for both the player and enemies. It's responsible for rendering and updating the entity, including moving and attacking
* archetype.py: Implements the Archetype class, which represents a player/enemy class, along with stats and other required assets for displaying
* archetypes.py: This is where the actual definition of the archetypes of the game is done
* combattext.py: Implements the combat text class, which tracks the data needed to display and animate the combat text of the game.
* utilities.py: A series of functions to help with the game. Currently, it only has functions to center text at a certain position and to render a progress bar.
